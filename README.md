## About the Project

This project is another assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) curriculum.

I learned a ton about DOM manipulation and event listeners with this one!

My main focus:

- Capturing user input through buttons and key inputs
- Handling the logic for mathematical operations
- Updating the display in real-time

I learned a ton about DOM manipulation and event listeners.

The calculator's styling is inspired by Apple's calculator!
